# 3D-DSN
The network architecture of our paper 3D-DSN

## Caffe library

We slightly modify the original Caffe library to supporting the 3D operations. You can find the Caffe library in [https://github.com/yulequan/3D-Caffe](https://github.com/yulequan/3D-Caffe).

For installation, please follow the offical instructions of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html).

## Note
- We use **HDF5DataLayer** to read data. You need to  generate the hdf5 data from original data type.
